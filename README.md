# Hand-Controlled-Snake-Game
This project is a modern twist on the classic Snake Game ðŸŽ®, where the snake is controlled not by a keyboard but through hand gestures tracked via webcam using MediaPipe and OpenCV. The game is built with Pygame and integrates real-time gesture recognition for an interactive gaming experience.
